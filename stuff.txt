== Bugs/Ideas ==
RECODE BUGS:
 - Quitting with only zombies on the server
 - Force showdown timers
 - Class descriptions
 - Handbook
 - Priest not getting stuff (but other priest in team did)

LOW PRIORITY / INVESTIGATE:
 - Destroying a building while it is built does not decrement building now counter
 - Zombie tab list names

FUTURE:
 - Named gamegroup configs that can be used to spawn varying gamegroups
 - Commands per gamegroup
 - Sym links for maps in RAM, and alternate map source folder.
 - Alternate config folder to allow servers to share config?


== New Idea ==
Minigames Plugin:
 - Base plugin for minigames
 - Provides no commands or permissions
 - Lets other plugins "register" gamegroup configs
 - Intercepts commands in precommand event, and handles them if gg config requires
 - One specific command lets console execute commands
 - Communicates with the minigames controller
 - SHOULD KILL GAMEGROUPS AFTER A GAME FINISHES
 - SHOULD RELOAD CONFIGS FROM DISK EACH TIME GG LOADED

 - Config: symlink option, map folder, gamegroup configs folder

Specific Minigame Plugin:
 - Registers one or more gamegroup configs with the base plugin
 - Does not have its commands in its plugin.yml, but does have its permissions

Minigames controller:
 - Keeps track of which servers are running which minigames, and commands them
 - Provides stats for all minigames (num players, etc...)
 - Manipulates bungee servers
 - Records minigame errors

== New Config Management ==
 - Have a central config folder for all minigames.
 - Map config names must begin with minigame prefix.
 - Plugins specify which gamegroup configs to load in their plugin config.
 - GameGroup configs located in main config directory.
